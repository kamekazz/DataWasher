# DataWasher

A simple Flask application skeleton.

This project includes simple pages for creating a user and logging in. These
forms demonstrate basic form handling but do not implement real authentication.

## Template structure

HTML templates are organized under `templates/`:

```
templates/
    pages/      # individual page templates
    elements/   # reusable elements such as header and footer
```
